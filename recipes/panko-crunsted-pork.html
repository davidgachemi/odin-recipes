    <h1><strong>Description</strong></h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        These pork chops, prepared in the air fryer, are enhanced by a simple brine. 
        With just a few seasonings in the crust, the chops are tender and juicy, crispy, and just right! Of course you may add more seasonings, if you like, just be careful of hiding the flavor of a simply delicious chop. We enjoyed these pork chops with potatoes in a cheese sauce and oven-roasted asparagus.

    <h1><Strong>Steps</Strong></h1>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Pour 1 cup water in a 4-cup microwave-safe measuring cup. Microwave until boiling, about 4 minutes. Stir in kosher salt and sugar, until dissolved. Add remaining 3 cups water to make a brine.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>Place rosemary sprig and bay leaf in a 1-gallon zip-top bag. Carefully pour in brine and add pork chops. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible, and refrigerate about 2 hours.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>Remove chops from the brine and discard the brine. Pat chops dry with paper towels.</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>Break egg into a shallow bowl and beat lightly. Combine panko, grated Parmesan, Italian seasoning blend, and black pepper, and place on a plate or cutting board. Dip each pork chop in the egg, then coat all sides with the panko mixture. Spray both sides of the coated chops with extra-virgin olive oil</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>Place chops in the air fryer in a single layer, with chops not touching, and air-fry for 7 to 8 minutes per side, for a total of 14 to 16 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><p>Serve warm, garnished with parsley and additional rosemary sprigs, if desired.</p></li>
        
    </ol>
